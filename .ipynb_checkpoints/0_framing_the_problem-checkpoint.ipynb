    "#### What is CRISP-DM?\n",
    "CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is a cyclical process that provides a structured approach to planning, organizing, and implementing a data mining project. The process consists of six major phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Understanding\n",
    "- Data Understanding\n",
    "- Data Preparation\n",
    "- Modeling\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "- Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I. Business Understanding: \n",
    "Any good project starts with a deep understanding of the customer’s needs. Data mining projects are no exception and CRISP-DM recognizes this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine business objectives: You should first “thoroughly understand, from a business perspective, what the customer/company really wants to accomplish.” (CRISP-DM Guide) and then define business success criteria.\n",
    "- Assess situation: Determine resources availability, project requirements, assess risks and contingencies, and conduct a cost-benefit analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "II. Data Understanding:\n",
    "Next is the Data Understanding phase. Adding to the foundation of Business Understanding, it drives the focus to identify, collect, and analyze the data sets that can help you accomplish the project goals. **You want to answer the Question, how can data solve this problem**. This phase also has four tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collect initial data: Acquire the necessary data and (if necessary) load it into your analysis tool.\n",
    "- Describe data: Examine the data and document its surface properties like data format, number of records, or field identities.\n",
    "- Explore data: Dig deeper into the data. Query it, visualize it, and identify relationships among the data.\n",
    "- Verify data quality: How clean/dirty is the data? Document any quality issues."
